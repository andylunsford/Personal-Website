SEO is more important than ever for your business. No matter how great your website is, or how excellent your products are, if nobody can find them, you won’t get sales or clients.

That’s where I come in. I’ve helped build SEO teams from the ground up at organizations I’ve worked at, and I would love to share my knowledge with you to help you get your products / services found online. With specific knowledge in the legal, retail, software, and manufacturing industries, I’ve had a wide array of experiences that give me a unique wide perspective on SEO, and I keep up with the latest algorithms and strategies in order to make sure that my clients are ahead of the curve.

I’ve helped companies double and triple their website impressions, and I’ve helped clients rank first on Google for keywords that matter the most to them. Let me help you develop your strategy today!

One thing that every business needs in today’s world is an online presence. Without it, companies are failing to be found online. One of the most legitimizing things you can do for your small to medium sized business is build a professional website.

But owning a website comes with a lot of responsibility. In addition to knowing what to put on your website, you also need to know how you’re going to secure your domain and host it. You need to own your domain, and also be able to host the files that make up your website. What happens if you don’t have your own server room? What happens if your website goes down? These are questions that luckily, you don’t have to answer with a good hosting environment set up. I will work with you to either host your website for a monthly fee that includes website maintenance, updates, and bug fixes, or connect you with a webhost who can provide you a good hosting package.
