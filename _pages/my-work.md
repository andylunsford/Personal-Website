<h1>Services</h1>
Almost anything you need assistance with in digital marketing, I can assist you with. With a wide skill set that includes SEO to PPC, Web Development to Web Design, &amp; Marketing Strategy to Brand Strategy, I will be able to help you grow your business even more. If I'm not able to help with anything, or you need more specialized help, I also partner with other vendors and freelancers who have additional skills and strengths that I will work with to make your next project a success.

SEO is more important than ever for your business. No matter how great your website is, or how excellent your products are, if nobody can find them, you won’t get sales or clients.

That’s where I come in. I’ve helped build SEO teams from the ground up at organizations I’ve worked at, and I would love to share my knowledge with you to help you get your products / services found online. With specific knowledge in the legal, retail, software, and manufacturing industries, I’ve had a wide array of experiences that give me a unique wide perspective on SEO, and I keep up with the latest algorithms and strategies in order to make sure that my clients are ahead of the curve.

I’ve helped companies double and triple their website impressions, and I’ve helped clients rank first on Google for keywords that matter the most to them. Let me help you develop your strategy today!

PPC is one of the fastest ways to bring customers to your website, today!

I've managed PPC campaigns on Amazon, Facebook, &amp; Google for industries ranging from legal to home decor.  A strong PPC campaign paired with an organic SEO strategy will get traffic to your website quickly, and build a strong foundation for the future.

PPC is a fantastic method to guide your customers to your website and tell them your story, and I would love to help guide them on this journey.

One thing that every business needs in today’s world is an online presence. Without it, companies are failing to be found online. One of the most legitimizing things you can do for your small to medium sized business is build a professional website.

But owning a website comes with a lot of responsibility. In addition to knowing what to put on your website, you also need to know how you’re going to secure your domain and host it. You need to own your domain, and also be able to host the files that make up your website. What happens if you don’t have your own server room? What happens if your website goes down? These are questions that luckily, you don’t have to answer with a good hosting environment set up. I will work with you to either host your website for a monthly fee that includes website maintenance, updates, and bug fixes, or connect you with a webhost who can provide you a good hosting package.

Design is more than just making things look pretty.  Well-done, smart design helps tell a story, and guides your users where you want to lead them, and helps build a visual presence that clients associate with professional companies.  Outdated designs can turn off customers even when the content is valuable and your SERP rankings are incredible.

While not formally trained as a designer, I have worked with designers on logo design, website layouts, and general design aesthetic to help you build the pillars of your brand.  Web design combines design knowledge with the technical skills to implement these designs on the web.

You've got a great product, service or business.  Now, how are you going to tell people about it?  Without a marketing strategy, there might not be anyone listening.

A strong marketing strategy will help you utilize all tools in the toolbox (SEO, PPC, Design, Branding, etc.) to create a cohesive campaign that tells your story and brings your customers right to your door.

I can help you create a targeted omnichannel strategy that will utilize all of these channels effectively and build a program custom-tailored to your business that will help you grow fast and bring even more customers to your doors.
