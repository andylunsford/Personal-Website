I make plugins for WordPress websites so that functions.php edits can be hooked in, and WordPress updates will not break website functionality. Another benefit to combining smaller bits of code into one plugin is improved site speed and reliability by minimizing interactions between plugins on the live site.  I do not do anything else special. If you got to this page because you were curious about this plugin, well done.

I can help assist you, feel free to <a href="http://www.andylunsford.com/contact-me/"> contact me</a> if you have interest in working on me on your new awesome project!
